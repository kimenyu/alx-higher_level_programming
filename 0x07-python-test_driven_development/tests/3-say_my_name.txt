 How to 3-say_my_name.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``say_last_name()``.

>>> say_my_name("Walter", "White")
My name is Walter White

>>> say_my_name("Jesse")
My name is Jesse 

>>> say_my_name(123, "White")
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: first_name must be a string

>>> say_my_name("Walter", 456)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: last_name must be a string
