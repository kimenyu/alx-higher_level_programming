#!/usr/bin/python3
number = 98
print(f"{number:d} Battery street")
#The expression {number:d} is a format specifier that indicates that the value of number should be formatted as a decimal integer (d stands for decimal). Since number is already an integer, the format specifier doesn't change its value or type. Therefore, the output of the code is simply "98 Battery street".
